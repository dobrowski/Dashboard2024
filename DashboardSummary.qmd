## Report Purpose

This report is created to assist `r dist.name` in reflecting on the student groups whose indicators led to Differentiated Assistance.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| results: asis


http_address <- glue::glue("https://www.caschooldashboard.org/reports/{dist}/{yr}")

cat("The graphic below shows the color for each student group for each indicator from the [California Dashboard", yr, "](", http_address, ")")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| include: true
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 8

dash.mry %>%
 #       mutate(statuslevel = statuslevel.orig) %>%
    dash.graph(dist.name) 

```

## Qualifying Groups

Differentiated Assistance is determined by the California Dashboard.

```{r}
#| results: asis 
#| echo: false 



da.inds <- dash.mry.da.details %>%
    filter(cds == dist) %>%
    select(indicator) %>%
 #   filter(indicator != "CCI") %>% # Only for 2023 since no history to compare
    unique() %>%
    unlist()



da.groups <- dash.mry.da.details %>%
    filter(cds == dist) %>%
    select(studentgroup) %>%
    unique() %>%
    unlist()



da.status <- dash.mry.da %>%
    filter(CDS == dist) %>%
    select(AssistanceStatus2025) %>%
    unique() %>%
    unlist()



```

The table below displays which student groups qualified `r dist.name` to be eligible for [`r da.status`](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/cm/leaproposedcrit.asp) by meeting the criteria for two or more LCFF priority areas according to California Education Code Section 52071(c). [California's System of Support](https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/sw/t1/csss.asp). The table shows for each student group which Priority Areas and associated indicators met qualification criteria.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| results: asis

dash.mry.da.details %>%
    filter(cds == dist) %>%
    select(studentgroup.long, indicator.list) %>%
    unique() %>%
    datatable(colnames = c("Student Group", "Qualifying Priority Areas"),
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(lengthChange = FALSE,
                         searching = FALSE)) 

```

## Status Details for all Indicators

These graphs represent all of the indicators from the Dashboard and show how each of the student groups performed. The light grey arrows represent change from the prior year. Arrows pointing to the right increased and to the left decreased, and the longer the tail length the greater the change.

## Historical Confetti

These graphs represent all of the indicators from Priority Areas that qualified the district. They included all qualifying subgroups on each graph, whether this was a qualifying indicator or not, as well as the All Students group for comparisons.

## Status Needed to Achieve Orange in `r yr+1`

This section estimates the limits for indicators that are Red in `r yr` to receive an orange or higher color next year on the `r yr+1` Dashboard. The thresholds below are based on the [5x5 grids last approved by the State Board of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/cm/fivebyfivecolortables19.asp#AcademicTable) and the number of students in the `r yr` calculation. State policies may change and the student counts may shift.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| results: asis


thresh.df <- exit.crit %>%
    filter(cds == dist)


thresh.tbl <- thresh.df %>% 
    mutate(change = thresh - currstatus) %>%
    select(studentgroup.long, indicator, currstatus, thresh, change, pass.count)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| results: asis

datatable(thresh.tbl,
          colnames = c("Student Group", "Indicator", "Current Status", "Target Status for Orange", "Change Needed", "Number of Students (as applicable)"),
          caption = paste0("Change in Indicators Needed to Exit Red in ",yr+1),
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(lengthChange = FALSE,
                         searching = FALSE)) %>%
    formatRound("change",1)

```
